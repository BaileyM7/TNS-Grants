# Grants.gov Daily Scraper and Story Generator

This project automates the process of downloading, parsing, and summarizing new federal grants posted on [Grants.gov](https://www.grants.gov). It filters grants by those posted **yesterday**, uses OpenAI's GPT API to generate news-style headlines and summaries, and either saves the results to a CSV file for review or inserts them into a MySQL database for production use. A log report is sent via email after each run.

  * **Production mode (`-p`)**: Inserts stories into a database with metadata tags.
* Sends a summary email report with attached log.
* Tags each grant by applicant type, funding category, and funding type.
